/*
Always prefer 'bin' as the default database collation instead of 'general_ci' or 'unicode_ci'.

Since collations are used in comparisons, the following statement would, for instance, update
all rows with name "Antonio" to "Ant么nio":

    update user set name = "Ant么nio" where name = "Ant么nio"

Collations are also used to determine uniqueness. If 'name' is a unique key, the table can't
have two rows with names "Antonio" and "Ant么nio".

The default collation can always be overridden as needed on a query basis:
